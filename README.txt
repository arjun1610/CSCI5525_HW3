NOTE: The order of the QUESTION in the REPORT HW3.pdf is 1,3,4 and then 2 which has the necessary figures and tables.

HOW TO COMPILE :

FOR Q2a
RUN THE FUNCTION - myBagging2.m with the input arguments as filename, B, k

FOR Q2b
RUN THE FUNCTION - myRForest2.m with the input arguments as filename, M, k

THINGS TO KNOW:
I have also included some figures for various Runs of Bagging and Random Forests.(In the Figures folder)

For Bagging: BaggingFull1, BaggingFull2, BaggingFull3
For Random Forest: RandomForestFull1, RandomForestFull2

Observations : 
Figures are shown for full dataset, and B and M as mentioned in the homework with number of folds being 10.
The figures are almost similar but the trend is somewhat fluctuating. At some values of B or M we see low error rates and some points we see higher error rates. This is because of the randomness in the data due to bootstrap sampling and (random features selection for random forest) 
Over all the error rates are limited to 15% or so.
